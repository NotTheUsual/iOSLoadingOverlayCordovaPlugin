# LoadingOverlay plugin

Cordova plugin that displays a full screen loading page with a message (we use it to transition through a bunch of pages in the background, you can use it for anything! (I mean, within reason)).

# Installation

     $ cordova plugins add https://github.com/NotTheUsual/GalleryCordovaPlugin
